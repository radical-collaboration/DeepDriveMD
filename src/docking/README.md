# Reinforcement learning for docking

## Execution

There is a script added to execute RLDock on Slate:

::

  python event_handler.py -i <input pdb> -o <output text score file>


This will replace the manual execution described earlier here: https://github.com/radical-collaboration/DeepDriveMD/issues/5
