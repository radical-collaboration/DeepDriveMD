# DeePMD

DeePMD is a neural network potential for molecular dynamics force fields. 
The training capability can be accessed through a separate executable `dp`.
The force field needs to be accessed through a molecular dynamics code such
as LAMMPS[^1] or ASE[^2].

The DeePMD code is accessible on GitHub[^3].
DeePMD also has a tutorial[^4].
